# actions-go-ci

A [GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) providing CI/CD for our Go
service repos.

This action is designed only for internal use but must be public due to current
limitations on [reusable
workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows#access-to-reusable-workflows).
